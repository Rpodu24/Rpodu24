### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Rpodu24/Rpodu24** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- I have done intermittent coding throughout middle school but I am still relatively new to coding. 
- My reasons for taking this class are because it interests me but also to diversify myself. 
- Some of my interests are Ice hockey, golf, lifting, and music. 
- Aa goal I have is that I want to know my way around coding and understand a language fully.
